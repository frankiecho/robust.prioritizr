#' Add a robust objective function
#'
#' @description
#' Specify an objective function for a conservation planning problem that
#' accounts for uncertainty. This function is used to add a robust objective
#' to a [prioritizr::problem()] object.
#'
#' @details
#' Robust objective functions are used to find solutions that are likely to
#' meet conservation targets across a range of different scenarios or
#' realizations of the input data. This is particularly useful when working
#' with data that is uncertain, such as species distribution models under
#' climate change scenarios.
#'
#' The following robust objective functions can be added to a
#' conservation planning problem:
#'
#' \describe{
#'
#'   \item{[add_robust_min_set_objective()]}{Minimize the cost of the solution
#'   while ensuring that all targets are met across all data realizations.}
#'
#'   \item{[add_robust_min_shortfall_objective()]}{Minimize the shortfall
#'   in meeting targets measured across all data realizations, subject to a budget.}
#'
