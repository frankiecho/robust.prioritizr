\description{
Add an objective to a conservation planning problem that minimizes the
representation shortfalls for each feature group using the worst case shortfall
or a quantile of the shortfall distribution,
whilst ensuring that the total cost of the solution does not exceed a budget.
}
\details{
The robust minimum shortfall objective seeks to find the set of planning
units that minimizes the representation shortfall for each feature group,
subject to a budget.
In particular, a target shortfall reflects difference
between the target for a feature and the amount held by a candidate solution,
expressed as a proportion of the target.
These target shortfalls are then calculated for each of the features
associated with a feature group, and a representation shortfall is used
describe how well all the features associated with a particular feature
group are represented by a candidate solution.
Thus this objective aims to get as close as possible to
reducing the representation shortfalls shortfalls to zero,
by getting as close as possible to reaching all of the targets
for the features associated with each of the feature groups.
In the robust minimum shortfall formulation, the algorithm attempts to
minimize the maximum shortfall within the feature group.
In particular, the chance constraint programming method
(Charnes and Cooper 1959) is used to formulate the optimization problem as a
mixed integer linear programming problem. With this method, the
confidence level parameter (i.e.,
specified per \code{conf_level} with \code{\link[=add_constant_robust_constraints]{add_constant_robust_constraints()}} or
\code{\link[=add_variable_robust_constraints]{add_variable_robust_constraints()}}) describes the quantile
of the target shortfalls associated with the feature group
that should be minimized during optimization. For example,
if \code{conf_level = 1} for a feature group, then the 100th quantile is used and
this means that -- after calculating the target shortfalls for each
feature associated with the feature group -- the largest target
shortfall for the associated features is used to calculate the
representation shortfall for the feature group.
If \code{conf_level = 0.5} for a feature group, then the
50th quantile is used and this means that the median target shortfall
for the features associated with the group is used to represent the
representation shortfall for the feature group.

\section{Mathematical formulation}{

This objective can be expressed
mathematically for a set of planning units (\eqn{I}{I} indexed by
\eqn{i}{i}), a set of feature groups (\eqn{J}{J} indexed by \eqn{j}{j}), and
a set of features associated with each feature group
(\eqn{K} indexed by \eqn{k}). Let \eqn{c_i}{ci} denote the cost of
planning unit \eqn{i}{i}, \eqn{R_{ijk}}{Rijk} the amount of feature
\eqn{k}{k} associated with planning unit \eqn{i}{i} for feature group
\eqn{j}{j}, \eqn{T_{jk}}{Tjk} the target for each feature \eqn{k} in each
feature group \eqn{j}, \eqn{W_{jk}}{Wjk} the weight for
each feature \eqn{k} in each feature group \eqn{j}, and \eqn{\alpha}{a} the
confidence level for uncertainty
(specified per \code{conf_level} with \code{\link[=add_constant_robust_constraints]{add_constant_robust_constraints()}} or
\code{\link[=add_variable_robust_constraints]{add_variable_robust_constraints()}}).
Additionally, to describe the decision variables,
let \eqn{x_i}{xi} denote the status of the planning unit \eqn{i}{i}
(e.g., specifying whether
planning unit \eqn{i}{i} has been selected or not with binary values),
\eqn{v_{jk}}{vjk} the target shortfall for each feature \eqn{k}{k}
associated with each feature group \eqn{j}{j},
and \eqn{y_j}{yj} the representation shortfall for
for each feature group \eqn{j}{j}.
Given this terminology, the robust minimum shortfall formulation of the
reserve selection problem is formulated as follows.

\deqn{
\mathit{Minimize} \space \sum_{j = 1}^{J} y_j \times
\frac{\sum_{k = 1}^{K} W_{jk}}{K} \\
\mathit{subject \space to} \\
\sum_{i = 1}^{I} x_i c_i \leq B \\
\Pr_ k\{\sum_{i = 1}^{I} ( x_i \times R_{ijk} ) +
  ( T_{jk} \times v_{jk} ) \geq T_{jk} \} \geq \alpha
  \quad \forall j \in J \\
y_j \geq v_{jk} \quad \forall j \in J, k \in K \\
0 \leq y_j \leq 1 \quad \forall j \in J
}{
Minimize sum_j^J (yj * (sum_k^K Wjk / K))
subject to sum_i^I (xi * ci) <= B
Pr_k \{ sum_i^I (xi * Rijk) + (Tjk * vjk) >= Tjk \} >= a, for all j in J
y_j >= vjk, for all j in J, k \in K
0 <= y_j <= 1, for all j in J
}

Here, the objective function (first equation) is to minimize the
weighted sum of the representation shortfalls for each feature group.
In particular, the representation shortfall for a given feature group
is weighted according to the average weight value of the features
associated with the feature group.
The budget constraints (second equation) ensure that the
solution does not exceed the budget.
The probabilistic constraints (third equation) specify that
only some of the target shortfall variables (i.e., \eqn{v_{jk}}{vjk})
associated with each feature group are used to calculate the representation
shortfall for each feature group, and the subset of target shortfall
variables that are used is based on the confidence level
(i.e., \eqn{\alpha}{a}).
For example, if \eqn{\alpha=1}{a=1}, then all of the target shortfall
variables associated with each feature group must be used for the
calculations.
Alternatively, if \eqn{\alpha=0.5}{a=0.5}, then only enough of the target
shortfall variables are required for the calculations to achieve a 50\%
chance of correctly calculating the target shortfall variables for a
given feature group.
The representation shortfall constraints (fourth equation) ensure
that the representation shortfall variable for each feature group must
be greater than or equal to the target shortfall variables of the
features associated with the feature group.
In combination with the other constraints, this means that
the representation shortfall variable for a given feature group
is calculated as the largest value of a subset of the
target shortfall variables for the features associated with the feature
group, and this particular subset is based on the confidence level.
Thus if \eqn{\alpha}{a} is closer to a value of 1, then the representation
shortfall variable for each feature group is calculated with
a greater degree of certainty and, in turn, the optimization process
seeks a solution that is more robust to uncertainty.
Since the probabilistic constraints are non-linear, an approximation method
is used to linearize them so that the optimization problem can be solved
with mixed integer programming exact algorithm solvers.

The chance constraint programming method is used to linearize the
probabilistic constraints (Charnes and Cooper 1959). To describe this
method, let \eqn{M_{jk}}{Mjk} denote a binary
auxiliary variable for each feature \eqn{k}{k} associated with
feature group \eqn{j}{j}. Also \eqn{K_j}{Kj} denote a
pre-computed value describing the number of
features associated with each feature group \eqn{j}{j}.
Given this terminology, the method involves replacing the probabilistic
constraints with the following linear constraints.

\deqn{
\sum_{i = 1}^{I} (x_i \times R_{ijk}) + (T_{jk} \times y_j) +
  (T_{jk} \times M_{jk}) \geq T_{jk} \quad
  \forall \space j \in J, \space k \in K \\
\sum_{k = 1}^{K_j} \frac{M_{jk}}{K_j} \leq 1 - \alpha \quad
  \forall \space j \in J\\
M_{jk} \in \{0, 1\}
}{
sum_i^I xi * Rijk + Tjk * yj + Tjk * Mjk >= Tjk, for all j in J, k in K
sum_k^Kj Mjk / Kj <= 1 - a, for all j in J
Mjk in \{0, 1\}
}

Here, the solution calculates the representation shortfall variable
for a given feature group based on a particular subset of the
target shortfalls for the associated features. Specifically, this
subset based on a particular number of the smallest target shortfall
variables based on \eqn{\alpha}{a}. For example, if a feature group is
associated with 40 features and \eqn{\alpha=0.75}{a=0.75}, then the
representation shortfall for the feature group is calculated by identifying
which 10 of these 40 features have the largest target shortfall variables,
and the shortfall variable used in the optimization process
is the minimum of these large shortfall values.
As such, the chance constraint programming method provides
an intuitive approximation of the probabilistic constraints.
