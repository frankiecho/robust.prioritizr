# robust.prioritizr: Robust Systematic Conservation Prioritization in R

The robust.prioritizr R package provides tools for building and solving
robust systematic conservation prioritization problems. It extends the
prioritizr package to account for uncertainty in the input data. This is
particularly useful when working with data that is subject to change,
such as species distribution models under climate change scenarios.

## Details

This package contains several vignettes that are designed to showcase
its functionality. To view them, please use the code
`vignette("name", package = "robust.prioritizr")` where `"name"` is the
name of the desired vignette (e.g., `"robust.prioritizr"`).

- robust.prioritizr:

  Brief introduction to the package.

- climate-sdm:

  Example using simulated data from a species distribution model.

- vic-cons-planning:

  Example using Victoria, Australia.
