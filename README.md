<!-- badges: end -->

The *robust.prioritizr R* package provides robust optimization
techniques for systematic conservation prioritization. This is important
because conservation prioritizations typically only consider the most
likely outcome associated with a conservation action (e.g., establishing
a protected area will safeguard a threatened species population) and
fail to consider other outcomes and their consequences for meeting
conservation objectives. By extending the *prioritizr R* package, this
package can be used to generate conservation prioritizations that
account of uncertainty in the climate change scenario projections,
species distribution models, ecosystem service models, and measurement
errors. In particular, prioritizations can be generated to be fully
robust to uncertainty by minimizing (or maximizing) objectives under the
worst possible outcome. Since reducing the associated with achieving
conservation objectives may sacrifice other objectives (e.g., minimizing
protected area implementation costs), prioritizations can also be
generated to be partially robust based on a specified confidence level
parameter. Partially robust prioritizations can be generated based on
the chance constrained programming problem (Charnes & Cooper 1959,
<doi:10.1287/mnsc.6.1.73>) and the conditional value-at-risk problem
(Rockafellar & Uryasev 2000, <doi:10.21314/JOR.2000.038>). For more
information, please see the video below.

## Installation

You can install the official version of the package from CRAN with the
following *R* code.

``` r
install.packages("robust.prioritizr")
```

Alternatively, you can install the development version from the online
code repository with the following *R* code.

``` r
if (!require(remotes)) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("frankiecho/robust.prioritizr")
```

## Example usage

Here is a short example showing to how to build a robust conservation
prioritization with the *robust.prioritizr* package. A conservation
prioritization involves a set of candidate places for management (termed
planning units) and a set of biodiversity elements (termed features),
such as species, ecosystems, or ecosystem services. To guide priority
setting, conservation prioritizations typically consider the most likely
outcome associated with implementing conservation management in a given
planning unit. For example, when considering protected area
establishment as a management option, conservation prioritizations
typically assume that establishing a protected area in a planning unit
will have a 100% chance of successfully protecting all the features that
are thought to inhabit the planning unit. However, this assumption may
lead to misplaced priorities if there is uncertainty in whether or not
features inhabit different planning units.

The package uses multiple alternative outcomes to explicitly account for
uncertainty. To achieve this, users should (i) input alternative
outcomes for each feature as separate feature into the prioritization
process, and (ii) specify which input features represent alternative
outcomes by grouping them together. For example, if there are 5
alternative outcomes for a particular species based on different climate
scenarios, then the data for these 5 scenarios should be input as
separate features and they should be assigned to the same feature group.
Below, we provide an example showing how to do this with some simulated
data.

``` r
# Load packages
library(robust.prioritizr)
library(prioritizr)
library(terra)
```

``` r
# Get planning unit data
pu <- get_sim_pu_raster()

# Get feature data
features <- get_sim_features()

# Preview data
print(pu)
```

``` r
# Define the feature groups.
# Here, we have data for 5 layers. Let's pretend that the first two layers
# correspond to different climate projections (i.e., alternative outcomes) for
# the same species (hereafter, species A) and the remaining layers correspond
# to another species (hereafter, species B). As such, we will
# assign the first two layers to the group A, and the remaining layers
# to the group B
groups <- c(rep("A", 2), rep("B", nlyr(features) - 2))

# Preview groups
print(groups)
```

    ## [1] "A" "A" "B" "B" "B"

``` r
# Build problem based on the robust minimum set objective,
# targets to secure 10% of each species, and a confidence level of
# 90% to obtain a solution that can meet the targets in a manner
